large random prime number (p%4=3)
large random prime number (q%4=3)
n = p * q
Select S (non-zero and relatively prime to n)
x = (s * s) % n
generate 10 bit output
	x = (x * x) % n
	B = B << 1 | x & 1

n-1 = 2^k * q
	set q = n-1 (its easy to get the values)
	q should be odd
	find value of k
a = randnum between 1 and n-1
inconclusive
